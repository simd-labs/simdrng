## [Unreleased]

### Added

- xoshiro256: arbitrary and power-of-two jump-ahead. `jump(n)` advances the state
  by exactly `n` calls to the generator (computing `x^n mod P(x)` on the fly via
  square-and-multiply in `GF(2)[x]`), addressing any stream offset in `[0, 2^64)`.
  `jump(pow2{e})` advances by `2^e` (via `x^(2^e) mod P(x)`), reaching strides
  beyond `2^64` with the same convention as the fixed jumps — `jump(pow2{128})`
  equals `jump()`. Both are available on `XoshiroScalar`, `XoshiroNative`, the
  dispatched `XoshiroSIMD`, and the Python bindings (`pow2` is exported there).
  The fixed `jump()`/`mid_jump()`/`long_jump()` strides are unchanged.

### Removed

- CodSpeed regression tracking: the `codspeed` workflow and CMake preset, the
  `SIMDRNG_ENABLE_CODSPEED` option, and the codspeed-cpp fetch. Benchmarks
  still run via Google Benchmark.
- The scalar-only build mode (`SIMDRNG_WITH_XSIMD=OFF`) and its dependency-free
  header install. xsimd and poet are now mandatory; the SIMD backends are always
  built. Consumers who only want a scalar generator can include
  `simdrng/xoshiro_scalar.hpp` directly.
- The self-contained scalar single-header (`simdrng-scalar.hpp`); only the
  SIMD-capable `simdrng.hpp` is published to the `single-header` branch.

### Changed

- poet is now integrated via `add_subdirectory` (its `add_subdirectory` bug is
  fixed upstream); xsimd is pinned to release `14.3.0` (de-forked to
  `xtensor-stack/xsimd`).

## [0.0.1]

First tagged release. The project was renamed from `VectorXoshiro`/`prng` to
`simdrng` and hardened for distribution.

### Added

- Optional xsimd backend via `-DSIMDRNG_WITH_XSIMD` (default ON). With it `OFF`,
  the library is dependency-free and header-only, exposing only the scalar
  generators; `simdrng::Xoshiro` then aliases the scalar implementation.
- `VERSION` file plus a generated `include/simdrng/version.hpp`
  (`SIMDRNG_VERSION_*` / `SIMDRNG_VERSION_STRING`), produced by
  `cmake/GenerateVersion.cmake` with a git-aware `-dev.N+g<sha>` suffix.
- Installable CMake package: `find_package(simdrng CONFIG)` with an exported
  `simdrng::simdrng` target. The package config emits `find_dependency(xsimd)` /
  `find_dependency(poet)` only when built with xsimd.
- Single-header amalgamation (`tools/amalgamate.py`) publishing two variants to
  the `single-header` branch: a fully self-contained `simdrng-scalar.hpp` and a
  SIMD-capable `simdrng.hpp` (poet inlined, xsimd kept external).
- Working Compiler Explorer links for the single-header demos, published to the
  `godbolt-links` branch (the SIMD demo uses Compiler Explorer's vendored xsimd).
- `.clang-tidy`, a `cmake/dev_helpers.cmake` split (CPM bootstrap, warnings,
  sanitizers, static analysis, coverage), and a CI analysis job.
- Compiler Explorer link generation workflow.
- `Install & Consume` CI workflow that installs the library (xsimd and
  scalar-only matrices) and builds a downstream `find_package` consumer against it.

### Changed

- **Renamed** the public surface: include directory `random/` → `simdrng/`,
  namespace `prng::` → `simdrng::`, and macros `PRNG_*` → `SIMDRNG_*`. Downstream
  code now uses `#include <simdrng/...>` and `simdrng::`.
- Switched xsimd from a force-pushed personal fork to upstream
  `xtensor-stack/xsimd` (pinned by SHA); `mulhilo` is now the upstream
  `xsimd::mul_hilo`.
- Pinned `poet` to its `v0.0.0` release.
- AVX-512 runtime dispatch now targets `avx512bw` (x86-64-v4: F+CD+BW+DQ+VL)
  instead of `avx512f`, unlocking `vpmullq` (AVX512DQ) for Philox `mul_hilo`.
- Normalized all CMake options to the `SIMDRNG_*` prefix; `SIMDRNG_BUILD_PYTHON`
  now defaults to `OFF` (scikit-build enables it explicitly for wheels).
- Rewrote the Philox round (scalar and SIMD) as a single data-driven loop over
  `N/2` counter pairs (multipliers/Weyl increments/output permutation in
  `PhiloxConstants`) instead of `if constexpr (N == 4)` branches; adding a new N
  is now just a constants specialization. The SIMD round uses `poet::static_for`.
