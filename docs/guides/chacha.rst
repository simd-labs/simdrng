ChaCha
======

What it is
----------

ChaCha is Bernstein's stream-cipher core (a variant of Salsa20) repurposed here
as a counter-based RNG. Each 64-byte block is a pure function of a 256-bit key,
a 64-bit block counter and a 64-bit nonce, run through ``R`` quarter-round
rounds. simdrng ships the three standard strengths: **ChaCha8**, **ChaCha12**
and **ChaCha20**.

When to use it
--------------

Use ChaCha when you want **cryptographic-grade statistical quality** or a
CSPRNG-style stream: the higher round counts (12, 20) are the cryptographic
choices, while ChaCha8 trades margin for speed. Because the block is a function
of ``(key, counter, nonce)``, streams are reproducible and seekable. For raw
throughput of non-cryptographic randomness, :doc:`xoshiro` is faster.

Scalar, SIMD dispatch, and native
----------------------------------

   * - Type
     - Header
     - Use when
   * - ``ChaCha<R>``
     - ``<simdrng/chacha.hpp>``
     - Portable, dependency-free scalar core (constructed from an explicit
       256-bit key).
   * - ``ChaChaSIMD<R>`` / ``ChaCha8SIMD`` …
     - ``<simdrng/chacha_simd.hpp>``
     - Runtime SIMD dispatch; also offers a seed constructor.
   * - ``ChaChaNative<R>`` / ``ChaCha20Native`` …
     - ``<simdrng/chacha_simd.hpp>``
     - Built with ``-march=native`` for the widest width with no dispatch.

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <simdrng/chacha_simd.hpp>

   simdrng::ChaCha20SIMD rng(42);     // seed, counter = 0, nonce = 0
   std::uint64_t x = rng();
   double u = rng.uniform();

The scalar ``ChaCha<R>`` is constructed from an explicit key, counter and nonce
(``ChaCha<20> rng(key, counter, nonce)``); the SIMD/native types add a
seed-based constructor that derives the key for you.

Periods and streams
-------------------

``R`` is always rounded up to an even number (odd and even rounds are issued in
pairs). Within a fixed ``(key, nonce)`` the 64-bit block counter gives a period
of 2\ :sup:`64` blocks. Re-running with the same ``(seed/key, counter, nonce)``
reproduces the stream exactly, and bumping the counter or nonce yields
different streams. The level tags (``simdrng::node``, ``simdrng::gpu``,
``simdrng::thread``) are jump-ahead positions in the block counter. One key
and nonce give disjoint streams. The levels do not touch the key or the
nonce. The readme lists the field widths and the stream length. See
:ref:`gen-properties` for the full period table.
